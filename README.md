## Instructions
Space is trashed and on our planets resources are running out! Recycle debris and return it to the core systems before it gets destroyed by an incoming meteor shower.

Use the mouse to select your main ship of a debris component and attach powerful navigation ion engines. The magnetic nature of the ship and debris allows for linking on contact. Collect as much as you can and bring the haul to the core planets in this sector.

W - Engage back thrusters (move forward) -

S - Engage front thrusters (move backwards) -

A - Engage angular thrusters (rotate left) -
